### Ask No More: Deciding when to guess in referential visual dialogue
#### COLING 2018
Our goal is to explore how the abilities brought in by a dialogue manager can be included in endto-end
visually grounded conversational agents. We make initial steps towards this general goal
by augmenting a task-oriented visual dialogue model with a decision-making component that
decides whether to ask a follow-up question to identify a target referent in an image, or to stop
the conversation to make a guess. Our analyses show that adding a decision making component
produces dialogues that are less repetitive and that include fewer unnecessary questions, thus
potentially leading to more efficient and less unnatural interactions.
